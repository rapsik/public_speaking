The Library, Monday 6th of May, 3:00 PM


Welcome to public speaking event!

Everyone can join, no need for any membership or registration.

If you feel uncomfortable about public speaking and want to practice
your skills you are welcome to join. We want to create a safe space
where people can “fail” gracefully - actually there's no such thing as
failing, just practicing with friends.

Each meeting will be led by a facilitator, who is decided at the
previous meeting. The facilitator will pick the subject of the day and
everyone will give a two-minute speech on that subject. The order of
the speakers is randomized. The subjects will be very random, it's the
act of speaking that we are practicing. After every speech there will
be a short feedback.

Welcome!
